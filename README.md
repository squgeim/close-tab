Close Tab Button
===

It's as simple as it sounds.

When using Microsoft Edge with vertical tab, you'll notice that there is no easy
way to quickly close the tab (when you are not in the mood to hit keys on the
keyboard) -- you have to move your mouse all the way to the left, wait for the
tabs panel to open up, then find the right cross button.

That's where this extension comes in -- a close button right there at the same
position every time.
